 CSS: Media Queries Exercise   

CSS: Media Queries Exercise
===========================
Update to 2023 and make it responsive and adaptative to different screen sizes:
*   Start with [this webpage](https://www.teaching-materials.org/_deprecated/csstools/exercises/exercise_media_before), which already has HTML and CSS for a header, navigation, content, sidebar, and footer. This is what it looks like:
    
    ![](https://www.teaching-materials.org/_deprecated/csstools/exercises/csstools_exercise_1_before.png)
    
      
      
    
*   Add a CSS media query and appropriate styles so that the webpage looks like the screenshot below when printed. Specifically:
    
    *   The header, navigation, and footer should be hidden.
    *   The sidebar should display under the main content.

*   Add a CSS media query and appropriate styles so that the webpage looks like the screenshots below when resized to smaller widths. Specifically:
    
    *   The sidebar should be hidden.
    *   The body should have no padding.
    *   The images shouldn't exceed the width of the window.
    *   The navigation items should each be on their own line.
    *   The header should be fixed, so that it stays at the top after scrolling.
